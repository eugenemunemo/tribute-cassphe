After dropping out of school, Nyovest signed with motswako record label, Impact Soundz which also signed artists including Tuks Senganga and Morafe in 2006.
            Nyovest and Impact Soundz relationship was substandard as they had creative differences.[16] In 2008, both parties separated making Nyovest an independent artist that time.

            Nyovest released his debut single, Gusheshe featuring Okmalumkoolkat in 2013. The song was then unveiled that it'll be the first official single from his debut album.

            In 2014, he then established his record label named Family Tree Records where he was the only signed artist. Thereafter in 2014, Nyovest released his second single, Doc Shebeleza which is eponymously inspired and titled after kwaito artist, Doc Shebeleza. The song received positive reviews from the public and was praised by notable acts including singer Yvonne Chaka Chaka.
            
            On July 18, 2014, Nyovest released his debut album Tsholofelo named after his sister.

            On March 4, 2017, Nyovest released the lead single Tito Mboweni from his third album Thuto. Named after the South Africa's
            Minister of Finance and former SARB governer Tito Mboweni, the song commercially trended for its lyric quote, "Shaa Shaa" 
            which is an onomatopoeia for a money note sound.

            Thuto was released in May 5, 2017. It was certified gold by RiSA on the day of its release and was then certified platinum
            within the following weeks. Nyovest announced his third "Fill Up" event, which was held on November 17, 2017, at the 94,736
            capacity stadium, FNB Stadium, Johannesburg. 
            The event was planned to fill only 75,000 of its capacity which was his biggest challenge. Nyovest had some struggles in funding 
            the show, but finally got 3 major sponsors in assisting him: Cîroc SA, SABC 1 and Budweiser. The event didn't sell all it's tickets
            but was an outstanding success.
            
            In 2018, Nyovest released his fourth album Sweet and Short. The album was certified platinum in it's day of release.
            Nyovest's following "Fill Up" event venue was at Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban which was scheduled on 1 December 2018.
            He managed to sell 68,000 tickets which was a favourable outcome. The following day, Nyovest performed at the Motsepe 
            Foundation presented event, Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 headlined by Beyoncé and Jay-Z.
